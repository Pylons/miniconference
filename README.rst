**My company loves Pylons, how can we help?!**

  Join the list and give us a hollar.  We would love more sponsorship for food and beverage (thank you to SurveyMonkey for lunch and beer). We could also use cash to offset our AV costs (conference will be streamed on justin.tv). 

Also our web presence currently sucks, so we would love any help anyone would be willing to offer!
